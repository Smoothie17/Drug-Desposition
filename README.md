# Drug-Disposition

Using PostgreSQL, I analyzed prescription health data for anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications between the years 2010 and 2018, specifically for the cities of Calgary and Edmonton. After conducting the analysis, I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to highlight the key insights and trends observed in the data.

Here's a link to the Tableau Public website to see the interactive Dashboard:
